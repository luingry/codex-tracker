# Codex Tracker mark

The mark is an open, square cycle: the long ink segment is used quota and the
short sage segment is the remaining allowance. Its gap makes the state feel
finite without borrowing the usual speedometer, robot, sparkle, or lettermark
language.

  `scripts/export-brand-assets.ps1` when the source changes. The exporter uses
  Windows `System.Drawing` and mirrors the source SVG's geometry.

The 64-unit master uses a 10-unit stroke so its narrowest visible feature is
2.5 px at 16 px. The shape is intentionally free of fine detail and remains
recognizable at tray sizes.
